Text=   1. Use Long and Complex Passwords.-\n Passwords must be at least 15 characters long.\n The longer the password, the more difficult it will be to\n crack.\n\n   2.Don't Reuse Passwords.-\n Avoid using the same password on multiple websites\n or services. If an account is compromised, all others\n will be compromised as well.\n\n   3.Change your passwords regularly.-\n Change your passwords periodically, especially for\n sensitive accounts such as email, online banking, and\n social networks.\n\n   4.Don't Save Passwords in the Browser.-\n Although convenient, saving passwords in the browser\n can be risky if someone gains access to your device.
