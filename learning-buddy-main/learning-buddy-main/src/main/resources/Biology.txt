Biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. It encompasses a wide range of fields that examine life from the molecular level to entire ecosystems.

Cell biology focuses on the structure and function of cells, which are the basic units of life. It includes the study of cellular processes such as respiration, division, and communication.

Genetics examines how traits are inherited and expressed in living organisms. It explores the role of DNA, genes, and chromosomes in heredity.

Ecology studies the relationships between organisms and their environments. It looks at how living things interact with each other and their surroundings, including the flow of energy and matter through ecosystems.

Evolutionary biology investigates how species change over time through processes like natural selection and genetic drift. It provides insights into the history of life on Earth and the diversity of living organisms.
