History is the study of the past, including the events, people, cultures, 
and societies that have shaped the world we live in today. 
It helps us understand how civilizations developed, how societies functioned, 
and how people lived in different time periods.

In ancient history, students learn about the earliest human civilizations 
such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. 
They explore the achievements of these civilizations in areas
such as architecture, government, and philosophy.

During the medieval period, students delve into the Middle Ages, a time of knights, 
castles, and feudalism. They learn about the rise of Christianity, the power of monarchies, 
and the cultural exchanges that occurred during this time.

In modern history, students study major events such as the Renaissance, 
the Age of Exploration, the Industrial Revolution, and the World Wars. 
They explore the impact of these events on society, technology, and global relations.
