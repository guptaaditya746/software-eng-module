Chemistry is the science that explores the
properties and behaviors of different substances
around us. At its core are tiny particles called atoms,
which are like the building blocks of all matter.
These atoms can join together to form molecules,
which are the smallest units of compounds
like water and sugar. Elements are special kinds
of atoms, each with its own unique set of properties.
For example, oxygen is a gas we breathe, while
iron is a solid metal used in making many things.
Understanding Chemistry helps us make sense of
everyday phenomena, like why ice melts
in the sun or why some foods taste sour.
By learning Chemistry, we unlock the secrets
of the world around us
