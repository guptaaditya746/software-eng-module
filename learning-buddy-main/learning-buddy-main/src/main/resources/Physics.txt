Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature. It seeks to understand the behavior of the universe at the most basic level, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies.

Mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces that cause this motion. It includes the study of concepts such as velocity, acceleration, and momentum.

Thermodynamics involves the study of heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. It explains how energy is transferred and transformed in physical processes.

Electromagnetism examines electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with matter. It covers phenomena such as electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetic waves.

Quantum physics explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, where the classical laws of physics no longer apply. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement.
