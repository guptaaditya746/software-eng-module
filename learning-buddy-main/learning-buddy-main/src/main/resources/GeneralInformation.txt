Hi learner! I'll guide you through how this marvelous app works.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Choose your topic of interest and read information about it.
2. In which level of difficulty would you like to play?
3. Play and have fun, but keep in mind that
    you have a limited number of lives. Each
    mistake costs you a life.
4. So, there are two outcomes: either you
    finish all the questions without losing all
    your lives and see your gaming results, or
    you fail and have to start over from step 1.
